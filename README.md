# Advanced Shopping Cart with React and TypeScript

This is a utility component that provides a context for managing a shopping cart in a React application. It includes functions for adding, removing, and updating items in the cart, as well as functions for opening and closing the cart.

The state of the cart is persisted using the useLocalStorage hook and the useState hook. The useLocalStorage hook is used to persist the state of the cart across page reloads, while the useState hook is used to store the open/closed state of the cart.

The ShoppingCartProvider component also renders a ShoppingCart component, which is likely responsible for displaying the contents of the cart and allowing the user to interact with it.

This component is built using the following technologies:

# Bootstrap:
 A popular front-end framework for building responsive, mobile-first web applications.
#   TypeScript:
 A typed superset of JavaScript that helps you write safer and more scalable code.
#   React Hooks:
 A new feature in React that allows you to use state and other React features without writing a class component.
How to use
To use the ShoppingCartProvider component, wrap it around the components in your application that need access to the shopping cart context.
